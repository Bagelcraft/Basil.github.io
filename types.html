                <div>Most Singaporean must go throught the phase of BTO(Built To Order) which replaced the predecessor Registration for Flats System (RFS) scheme,, whereby the waiting time for new flat applicants was relatively shorter because flats were built ahead of demand. 
                     But for eligible flat buyers in urgent need of accommodation, they can ballot for leftover units that are reintroduced into the market, known as Sales of Balance flats (SBF).

                    Executive condominiums (EC) are private-public properties developed to cater to "sandwich class" Singaporeans. These homes are intended for Singaporeans who are not allowed to buy HDB flats due to surpassing the income limit but are also unable to afford private residential properties.</div>

                    <div>In fact, the monthly income ceiling to be allowed to buy ECs is $16,000, compared to $7,000 to $14,000 for new HDB flats. A fusion of public and private housing, ECs are constructed and sold by private homebuilders but are more affordable as their land cost is partly funded by the government.</div>

                    <div>In addition, applicants can utilise CPF grants to help offset the price of ECs, which come with amenities similar to that of private condos. These include a gym, clubhouse, swimming pools and gated security.</div>
